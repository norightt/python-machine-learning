Это скорее всего связано с тем, что пришлось использовать обычный Grid Search из sklearn, нежели чем, как при первой попытке кэтбустинга c помощью catboost.grid_search, из-за чего все получилось гораздо и гораздо быстрее, чем сейчас...в первый раз занчло минуту, а во второй 80 секунд..в общем не получилось быстрее, конкретно в данной ситуации, когда использовали pool для смешанных данных.

По времени худшим оказался CatBoosting, но нужно брать во внимание, что я сделала грид серч сразу по всем параметрам и это все заняло 80 секунд, при этом в XGBoost я разбивала параметры на 6 частей и отдельно делала грид серо, каждый из которых занял около минуты. Поэтому справедливо будет сказать, что худшим по времени будет именно XGBoost. С другой стороны, лучшей по времени получился обычный catboost, потому что он с помощью внутреннего аттрибута сделала грид серч по всем параметрам за 11 секунд, также можно отметить LightGBM, который при разбитии на отдельные группы для грид серча, выполнен каждый где то за 6 секунд.\n",
